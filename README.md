# TrumpBot2016

This is project to give me some practice with implementing a chatbot 
and an AIML 2.0 interpreter.

# TODOs

- Create the basic bot class that generates an output nased on an input
- Begin implementing AIML 2.0 (Can be broken out into smaller more manageable steps when appropriate)
- Add and tweak supporting AIML files (start with Rosie base, perhaps)
- Persist conversations to database?
