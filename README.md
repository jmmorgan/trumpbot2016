# TrumpBot2016

This is a project to give me some practice with implementing a chatbot 
and an AIML 2.0 interpreter.

# Next up TODOs

- Build a training interface to accelerate the building of TrumpBot's brain (maybe use Pandarobots trainer as a guide)
- Implement support for `<topic>`
- Make PatternMatcher and Chat specs independent of production Graphmaster instance.
