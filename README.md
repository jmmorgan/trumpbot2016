# TrumpBot2016

This is a project to give me some practice with implementing a chatbot 
and an AIML 2.0 interpreter.

# Next up TODOs

- Keep pushing ahead with the fun part of adding personality by editing/adding proprties files and AIML files.
- Log all requests/responses to database. Associate each exchange with session so conversations can be recreated.
- Create new ChatSession in database if user clears conversation.
- Look at implementing support for <that> (then maybe <topic>).
- Look at improving or doing away with denormal.substitution
