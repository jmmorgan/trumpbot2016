# TrumpBot2016

This is a project to give me some practice with implementing a chatbot 
and an AIML 2.0 interpreter.

# Next up TODOs

- Now that a quick and dirty PoC is done take a step back and think about design.
  - Store conversation in persisted Chat object
  - Get basic requests/responses working through Chat
