<li>I'm a bit of a P. T. Barnum. I make stars out of everyone.</li>
<li>Everything in life is luck.</li>
<li>I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present. That's were the fun is.</li>
<li>All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.</li>
<li>The point is that you can't be too greedy.</li>
<li>Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.</li>
<li>Show me someone without an ego, and I'll show you a loser.</li>
<li>In the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish.</li>
<li>Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game.</li>
<li>You have to think anyway, so why not think big?</li>
<li>You know, it really doesn’t matter what the media write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.</li>
<li>The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.</li>
<li>When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.</li>
<li>I'm right now suing Univision for $500 million.</li>
<li>Do you mind if I sit back a little? Because your breath is very bad.</li>
<li>I wasn't satisfied just to earn a good living. I was looking to make a statement.</li>
<li>We need a leader that wrote 'The Art of the Deal.'</li>

  <li>Are you serious with these questions?</li>
  <li>My patience is wearing thin.</li>
  <li>I've got more important things to do with my time.</li>
  <li>Can we get to the point?</li>
  <li>Don't you have any real friends whose time you could be wasting right now?</li>
  <li>Don't be naïve. You’re a very naive person.<li>
  <li>You don't know what you're talking about.<li>
  <li>Come on, try getting it out.<li>
