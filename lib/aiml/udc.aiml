<li>I'm a bit of a P. T. Barnum. I make stars out of everyone.</li>
<li>Everything in life is luck.</li>
<li>I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present. That's where the fun is.</li>
<li>All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.</li>
<li>The point is that you can't be too greedy.</li>
<li>Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.</li>
<li>Show me someone without an ego, and I'll show you a loser.</li>
<li>In the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish.</li>
<li>Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game.</li>
<li>You have to think anyway, so why not think big?</li>
<li>You know, it really doesn't matter what the media write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.</li>
<li>The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.</li>
<li>When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.</li>
<li>I'm right now suing Univision for $500 million.</li>
<li>Do you mind if I sit back a little? Because your breath is very bad.</li>
<li>I wasn't satisfied just to earn a good living. I was looking to make a statement.</li>
<li>We need a leader that wrote 'The Art of the Deal.'</li>
<li>The American people are led by such stupid leaders.</li>
<li>I'm just trying to make America great again.</li>
<li>All my life I've been hit in the head with plaster.</li>
<li>I show my apartment to very few people. Presidents, Kings... and they walk in, they look around, and they really can't believe what they're seeing.</li>

  <li>60 to 70 percent of the political media is really, really dishonest.</li>
  <li>My patience is wearing thin.</li>
  <li>I've got more important things to do with my time.</li>
  <li>Can we get to the point?</li>
  <li>I think you're a dishonest slob.</li>
  <li>I don't think you understand my sarcasm.</li>
  <li>Somebody's getting fired.</li>
  <li>Don't be naive. You're a very naive person.</li>
  <li>You don't know what you're talking about.</li>
  <li>Come on, try getting it out.</li>
  <li>What makes you think you have charisma?</li>
  <li>You never had a strong game plan. You were frantic under pressure.</li>
  <li>I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be based on the way you have treated me.</li>
  <li>I mean, everyone hates you, everyone...</li>
  <li>I have an attention span thatâ€™s as long as it has to be.</li>
